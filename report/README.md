# SDSS_S82

This is the new, updated and reorganized report, started with the aim  to describe our analysis of the SDSS Stipe 82 data. It does not include I have done with Stripe 82 reprocessed data. Specifically, we include  :


-  what is S82: location, area, etc , and what was different in Summer 2013 reprocessing, relevant docs, etc. 

-  what is in the dataset : object tables and forced photometry tables.  How they are similar to data products in LSST
( point to Yusra's thesis which describes that  )

- our aim : to calculate new aggregates, and thus aid classification of variable sources by combining color and 

A repository describing research on the SDSS Stripe 82 data reprocessed in the Summer 2013 as part of the [LSST Data Challenge](https://dmtn-035.lsst.io) (also see notes 
[here](https://dev.lsstcorp.org/trac/wiki/DC/Winter2013)). 

Description of methods developed to process the forced photometry data is beyond the scope of this report. The problem of faint fluxes, and how well can we extract the information about the underlying  source flux for low signal to noise is described in  the  [faint flux pipeline report](https://github.com/suberlak/Faint_pipeline_report). Comparative tests of various variability detection methods are described in the [variability detection report](https://github.com/suberlak/Variability_report).
